   * `DeletionPolicy` attribute, AWS CloudFormation deletes the resource by
   * default, except for:
   *
   *  - For `AWS::RDS::DBCluster resources`, the default policy is `Snapshot`.
   *  - For `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` resources that don't specify the
   *    `DBClusterIdentifier` property, the default policy is `Snapshot`.
   *  - For Amazon S3 buckets, you must delete all objects in the bucket for
   *    deletion to succeed.
   *
   * This capability also applies to stack update operations that lead to
   * resources being deleted from stacks. For example, if you remove the
   * resource from the stack template, and then update the stack with the
   * template. This capability doesn't apply to resources whose physical
   * instance is replaced during stack update operations. For example, if you
   * edit a resource's properties such that CloudFormation replaces that
   * resource during a stack update.
   *
   * To keep a resource when its stack is deleted, specify Retain for that
   * resource. You can use retain for any resource. For example, you can retain
   * a nested stack, Amazon S3 bucket, or EC2 instance so that you can continue
   * to use or modify those resources after you delete their stacks.
   *
   * For resources that support snapshots, such as `AWS::EC2::Volume`, specify

  /**
   * Use the UpdateReplacePolicy attribute to retain or, in some cases, backup
   * the existing physical instance of a resource when it's replaced during a
   * stack update operation.
   *
   * When you initiate a stack update, AWS CloudFormation updates resources
   * based on differences between what you submit and the stack's current
   * template and parameters. If you update a resource property that requires
   * that the resource be replaced, CloudFormation recreates the resource during
   * the update. Recreating the resource generates a new physical ID.
   * CloudFormation creates the replacement resource first, and then changes
   * references from other dependent resources to point to the replacement
   * resource. By default, CloudFormation then deletes the old resource. Using
   * the `UpdateReplacePolicy`, you can specify that CloudFormation retain or,
   * in some cases, create a snapshot of the old resource.
   *
   * For resources that support snapshots, such as `AWS::EC2::Volume`, specify
   * Snapshot to have CloudFormation create a snapshot before deleting the old
   * resource instance.
   *
   * You can apply the `UpdateReplacePolicy` attribute to any resource.
   * `UpdateReplacePolicy` is only executed if you update a resource property
   * whose update behavior is specified as Replacement, thereby causing
   * CloudFormation to replace the old resource with a new one with a new
   * physical ID. For example, if you update the Engine property of an
   * `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` resource type, CloudFormation creates a new resource
   * and replaces the current DB instance resource with the new one. The
   * `UpdateReplacePolicy` attribute would then dictate whether CloudFormation
   * deleted, retained, or created a snapshot of the old DB instance. The update
   * behavior for each property of a resource is specified in the reference
   * topic for that resource in the AWS resource and property types reference.
   * For more information on resource update behavior, see Update behaviors of
   * stack resources.
   *
   * The `UpdateReplacePolicy` attribute applies to stack updates you perform
   * directly, in addition to stack updates performed using change sets.
   *
   * `UpdateReplacePolicy` differs from the `DeletionPolicy` attribute in that
   * it only applies to resources replaced during stack updates. Use
   * `DeletionPolicy` for resources deleted when a stack is deleted, or when the
   * resource definition itself is deleted from the template as part of a stack
   * update.
